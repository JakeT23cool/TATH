Merge sort is an example of a 'divide-and-conquer' algorithm because it splits down a larger problem into a number of smaller ones which are then solved. Each solution is then combined in some way to solve the larger problem. ADVANTAGES: It is the fastest of three types of sort (bubble, insert, merge); It is the best option to use for long lists of data (more than 1000 long); DISADVANTAGES: More complicated to code compared to bubble and insertIt may use twice the memory size of the list - depending on the way it is coded.

      "The merge sort was developed to handle the sorting of large lists. It does this by breaking them down into multiple smaller lists, quickly sorting them, and then merging them back together into one larger list; i.e. it is faster to sort these two lists then merge them back together than to sort the list in its entirety. Merge sort is an example of a 'divide-and-conquer' algorithm because it splits down a larger problem into a number of smaller ones which are then solved. Each solution is then combined in some way to solve the larger problem. ADVANTAGES: It is the fastest of three types of sort (bubble, insert, merge); It is the best option to use for long lists of data (more than 1000 long); DISADVANTAGES: More complicated to code compared to bubble and insertIt may use twice the memory size of the list - depending on the way it is coded. This becomes important if the list is millions of items long."

Lossy compression will decrease the file size so that it can be sent via email. Lossy compression makes a file smaller and enables it to be sent more easily. As Reuben wants to send his music file by email,reducing file quality and reducing file size using lossy compression is ideal.
